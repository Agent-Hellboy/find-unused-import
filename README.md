find_unused_import
==================

My solution to **find_unused_import** problem of python.

Maybe this will be changed to remove_unused_import as flake8 is allready doing this.

General Info
============
  - The whole point of making this is using a naive approch to solve the find_unused_imports problem of python
  - I have zero to minimal design experience so any suggestions on design are welcome.
  - I hope I must have missed to parse some node from ast Like node related to Match of latest python release  
  - Play around with it and help me improve it.
 

How to Use
==========
 - Install the package using `sudo python setup.py install` and run
 - find_unused_imports --name=file_path
